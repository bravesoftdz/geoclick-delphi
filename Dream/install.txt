Please read scripts.txt for details.


General Notes/Installation hints
============================================================

* There are many Q&A in FAQs. Please look in help.

* If you work under  C++Builder  and encounter problems with
  Dream Controls try to set "Incremental linking" option off
  and press "Release" button in Options|Project|C++ tab. You
  can also try to turn off "precompiled headers" option.

* Files *_D5.pas, *_D4.pas, *_D3.pas, *_C5.pas, *_C4.pas and
  *_C3.pas  weren't included  in  the registered version  of
  Dream Scripter.  You can generate them  automatically with
  \UTILS\IMPGEN program.

* If  you want  to use  "External run"  feature  of  Instant
  Report  you need  to build \UTILS\RUNNER project  and copy
  dcrunner.exe to directory where Instant.exe is.

* We used  such Delphi and CPB builds  to compile  our trial
  versions:

   D3  5.83
   D4  5.108
   D5  6.18
   C3  3.70
   C4  14.11
   C5  12.34

   If  you  try  to install  our trial  in other  Delphi/CPB
   version  it  may  not  compile.  Registered versions  are
   compatible with any Delphi/CPB build.

Before  installation  in  Delphi/CPB   you  need  to  modify
\UNITS\prod.inc file:

   a) If you don't have  "Dream Tree"  product,  comment out
      define
        {$DEFINE DREAMTREE}

   b) If you don't have  "Dream Inspector"  product, comment
      out define
        {$DEFINE DREAMINSPECTOR}

   c) If you don't have  "Dream Designer"  product,  comment
