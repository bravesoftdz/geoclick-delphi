        How to Make a New Resource File for Another Language
        ----------------------------------------------------

In the zip project, we use resource files to hold the 
error messages that can be generated.  This lets us support 
more than 1 language without much trouble.

For now, these are the languages we support. 
   ZipMsgBR.res - Brazilian (Portuguese)
   ZipMsgCN.res - Chinese [ GB(K) - commonly used in China and Singapore for
                            simplified Chinese writing.]
   ZipMsgCZ.res - CZech
   ZipMsgNL.res - Dutch
   ZipMsgFR.res - French
   ZipMsgDE.res - German
   ZipMsgGR.res - Greek
   ZipMsgIT.res - Italian
   ZipMsgTW.res - Taiwanese [Big5 - commonly used in Taiwan and Hong Kong for
                             traditional Chinese writing.]
   ZipMsgPT.res - Polish
   ZipMsgRU.res - Russian
   ZipMsgYU.res - Serbian (Yugoslavia)
   ZipMsgS1.res - Spanish
   ZipMsgUS.res - US / English

We would like YOU to help us by porting the error messages
from English into another language that we don't support yet.

The files ZipMsg.h holds the resource Id numbers, and ZipMsgUS.rc
holds the source for the English text error messages.

To make a resource file for a new language, follow these
steps:

1) select a 2 letter code for your language
   example: "DE" for German (Deutch)

2) Create a new source file for your messages:
   COPY ZipMsgUS.rc ZipMsgDE.rc

3) Edit your new file - translate the text to your language
   NOTEPAD ZipMsgDE.RC

4) Compile your source to make a RES file:
   C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder3\bin\brc32 ZipMsgDE.RC

5) E-mail me your new .RC and .RES files! Tell me the full 
   name of the new language, and your full name and e-mail address.
   I will refer to your name and address in the help file unless
   you tell me not to.

NOTE
----
On Oct 2, 1998 we changed the resource Id numbers.
Now they are all over 10,000 to help avoid conflicts.
