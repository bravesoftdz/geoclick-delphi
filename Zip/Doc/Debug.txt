A note on debugging your application using TZipMaster or TZipBuilder:


If there's anything wrong with your event handler procedures,
you may get an error message from Windows saying something
is wrong with one of the DLLs.


This is because the DLLs become the "active program" when they
are busy, and your event handlers are "slave" functions/procedures.
Any serious errors in your event handlers will be reported as 
problems with the "active program", which is the DLL.


Don't forget that you can trace through the DLLs using TZipBuilder's/
TZipMaster's "Trace" property.  "Trace" reports progress messages
through your OnMessage event handler.  This is a very handy option.

Fatal errors from Windows normally appear in the center of your
screen.  If you are tracing, and you get a fatal error, you will
not be able to scroll your trace window.  Also, you won't be able
to move the Windows, and they will all close when you dismiss the
Windows fatal error.  So, you should put your trace Window in the
upper right part of your screen, and set it to "poDesigned".  This
will let you see what is in the Window in case a fatal error occurs.
